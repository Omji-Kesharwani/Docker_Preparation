What is  an image ?
A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.

There are two important principles of images:

1.Images are immutable. Once an image is created, it can't be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.

2.Container images are composed of layers. Each layer represents a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files
